# ==============================================================================
#  Portia AI in Action (V7 - Final Corrected Version)
#
#  This version fixes the InvalidConfigError by:
#  1. Requiring a valid GOOGLE_API_KEY.
#  2. Cleaning up the configuration to a single, clear definition.
#  3. Using a standard, valid model name.
# ==============================================================================

# 1. First, install the necessary libraries
# pip install portia-ai google-generativeai python-dotenv
import os
from portia import Portia, Config
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# --- 2. Load and Set the API Key ---
print("üîß Loading environment variables...")
load_dotenv() # Loads variables from a .env file first, if it exists

# CRITICAL FIX: Replace the placeholder with your actual Google API Key.
# The previous error was because this was an empty string.
api_key = "AIzaSyCkEOhVhFpPbkXE93OIDsf-0CGGI7b30xM"
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = api_key

# --- 3. Initialize the Portia Client with Correct Configuration ---
print("\nü§ñ Initializing the Portia client...")
try:
    # We define the configuration in one clean step.
    # The provider is inferred from the model name prefix "gemini/".
    config = Config.from_default(default_model="google/gemini-2.0-flash")

# (This section is correct and remains unchanged)

Generate a complete and engaging YouTube video script based on the following detailed requirements:

**Host and Channel:**
- The host's name is "{host_name}".
- The channel is called "{channel_name}".

**Core Content to Synthesize:**
- The script must smoothly integrate these topics:
  1. "{transcripts[0]}"
  2. "{transcripts[1]}"
  3. "{transcripts[2]}"

**Style and Format Instructions:**
- Adhere strictly to these creative guidelines: "{additional_instructions}".

**Mandatory Outro:**
- The script must end *exactly* with the following lines, in this order:
  - "{signature_lines[0]}"
  - "{signature_lines[1]}"

Execute this task and provide only the final, complete script as your output.
